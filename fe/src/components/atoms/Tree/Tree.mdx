# Tree

## Todo

- Comment it
- Consider implement the [ARIA Tree View pattern][aria-tree]
- Kinds of tree we should build to test our own dog foods:

  - Todo list, with add, check, edit, remove.
  - File explorer, with add, delete, move, drag and drop.
  - Nested comments page.

- The interactive of tree Row right now and support for single/multi select is
  not well-thought-out yet. I need to work on something else before I can
  finalize my thought.
