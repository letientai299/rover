Atom is the foundation, primitive kind of element.

## Icon

It's actually just a type that allow using the `IconType` from `react-icons` in
our base components without actually depends on that packages. In case we
migrate to another icon sets later, or move the base components into a library,
we don't want to install `react-icons` just for its type.
