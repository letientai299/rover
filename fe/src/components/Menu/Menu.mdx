# Menu

A basic menu should be displayed vertically, has several list of **string** as
choices. Each choice could optionally have mnemonic character and associated
keyboard shortcuts.

TODO:

- Need to make sure mnemonic won't be conflict. Or, in case of conflict, don't
  display it and print a warning logs instead.
- Need to work on the keyboard shortcuts mechanism to use with menu.

Menu could appear as a context menu (right click), or after some button pressed
(left click, focus+enter).

Tooltip appears on hover, can contains links, thus, should be clickable.
