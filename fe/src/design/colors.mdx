# Colors

I want my application have only a few base colors. UI element state should be
distinguishable base on different shades or tints of color. I also want those
color be automatically detected by the chosen system accent color, to that my
application can blend well among the system UIs.

## Terms

Let's recap some terminology about colors:

- Hue: pure color, or the family of the color we are looking at.
- Tint: Hue mixed with white
- Shade: Hue mixed with black
- Tone: Hue mixed with gray (which is itself a combination of white and black).

There are also some more properties, terminology like warmness, saturation, ...
But, I don't know much and can't care much about them. If any, I think I will
look for cold color for my application, because I want it to be a professional
tools, not a toy with "charming", "warming" emotion.

## What we need?

First, we need colors for these:

- Background: we will need multiple color of similar hue, to highlight multiple
  parts of the application UI:

  - Primary: BG of the main content page, like VSCode, Webstorm Editor
    background.
  - Secondary: BG of the left sidebar, which is used to represent _global data_,
    whose scope is usually higher than the main content, thinks about File
    Explorer in VSCode.
  - Tertiary: BG of the right sidebar, which is typically represent _local
    data_, such as table of content of a single document.

- Foreground: mainly text, but also SVG icon stroke color, border, shadow, .. We
  will need many colors for this, to indicate many levels of highlight.
  - Normal text.
  - Title, or header. We might not need a different colors, just use bigger font
    and bolder weight, which should give them a "stronger" appearance.
  - Clickable text/shape, i.e. links or _ghost buttons_.

UI elements will have different states. Some can be distinguished by shape. But,
my graphic design skills are limited. Hence, for now, I want most of them to
have their colors updated.

- Disabled:
- Normal
- Focus
- Active, or clicked/pressed
- Selected (think about selecting multiple file item before copying or deleting)
- Dragged

Color is also used to indicates the importance of actions:

- Default or the most common and sensible option in a group of buttons should
  have a different style. Let's call it the _primary button_.

- Those dangerous actions (deleting something, block someone) should have a
  different color rather than normal and primary. It's typically some form of
  red or orange.

Sometimes, the roles of background and foreground could be reversed. For
example, _filled button_ (has rectangle shape at normal state) or a progress bar
which displays status and value inside itself.
