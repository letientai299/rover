## VSCode Like

Although this is not bad, open some doors for a much more advanced/complicated
app, I don't want to use it for something that target normal (i.e.
non-developer) users. There's not many thing to put on the **Activity** bar.
Even the sidebar, beside **Favorite**, I don't know what else to put there.

<VSCodeLike platform={'mac'} />

## Ranger like

<RangerLike platform={'linux'} />
