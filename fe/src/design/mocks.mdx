## VSCode Like

Although this is not bad, open some doors for a much more advanced/complicated
app, I don't want to use it for something that target normal (i.e.
non-developer) users. There's not many thing to put on the **Activity** bar.
Even the sidebar, beside **Favorite**, I don't know what else to put there.

<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Header
    style={{
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      textTransform: 'uppercase',
    }}
  >

  </Accordion.Header>
  <Accordion.Body>
    <VSCodeLike platform={'mac'} />
  </Accordion.Body>
</Accordion.Root>
